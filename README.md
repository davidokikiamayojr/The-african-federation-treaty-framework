## About

The African Federation Treaty Framework (AFTF) v3.1 presents a rigorous, executable blueprint to eliminate Africa's systemic fragmentation — an estimated annual opportunity cost exceeding €290 billion — through a self-executing Tripartite System grounded in absolute sovereignty, sovereign finance, unified defence, and algorithmic governance.

This version elevates the framework from conceptual architecture to a binding jurisprudential treatise. It formally establishes the supremacy of Federation law and introduces foundational new modules:

- **Digital & Cognitive Sovereignty** (Art. 8) — Lattice-based cryptography and native synthetic intelligence to immunise African decision-making against external cognitive and digital threats.  
- **Commercial & Logistical Anchors** (Art. 9) — Northlands (Nairobi) and Mai Mahiu (UADF HQ) as bonded trade facilitation hubs governed by OmniGaza® real-time settlement protocols.  
- **Phased Governance Strata** (Art. 10.6) — Tiered onboarding (Silver, Gold, Platinum) governed by the Master Sovereign Investment Agreement (MSIA).  
- **Jurisdictional Finality** (Art. 11–13) — Federation Court with Supremacy Override, ensuring permanent constitutional federation.

**Core Pillars**  
- African Sovereign Development Finance Fund (ASDF) — generational infrastructure capital engine  
- OmniGaza® — sovereign-grade blockchain substrate for algorithmic fidelity, transparency, and instant settlement  
- United African Defence Force (UADF) — unified continental military and intelligence architecture  
- African Rare Earth Mineral Fund (AREMF) — sovereign control and value retention over critical minerals

The AFTF is not aspirational rhetoric. It is operational machinery designed to dismantle fragmentation and secure Africa's €3.4 trillion+ economic destiny.
