About the AFTF
The African Federation Treaty Framework (AFTF) v3.1 presents a rigorous, executable blueprint to eliminate Africa's systemic fragmentation — an estimated annual opportunity cost exceeding €290 billion — through a self-executing Tripartite System grounded in absolute sovereignty, sovereign finance, unified defence, and algorithmic governance.
This version elevates the framework from conceptual architecture to a binding jurisprudential treatise. It formally establishes the supremacy of Federation law and introduces foundational new modules:
 * Digital & Cognitive Sovereignty (Art. 8) — Lattice-based cryptography and native synthetic intelligence to immunise African decision-making against external cognitive and digital threats.
 * Commercial & Logistical Anchors (Art. 9) — Northlands (Nairobi) and Mai Mahiu (UADF HQ) as bonded trade facilitation hubs governed by OmniGaza® real-time settlement protocols.
 * Phased Governance Strata (Art. 10.6) — Tiered onboarding (Silver, Gold, Platinum) governed by the Master Sovereign Investment Agreement (MSIA).
 * Jurisdictional Finality (Art. 11–13) — Federation Court with Supremacy Override, ensuring permanent constitutional federation.
Core Pillars - African Sovereign Development Finance Fund (ASDF) — generational infrastructure capital engine
 * OmniGaza® — sovereign-grade blockchain substrate for algorithmic fidelity, transparency, and instant settlement
 * United African Defence Force (UADF) — unified continental military and intelligence architecture
 * African Rare Earth Mineral Fund (AREMF) — sovereign control and value retention over critical minerals
