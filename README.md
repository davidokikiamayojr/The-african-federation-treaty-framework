## 📋 About

The African Federation Treaty Framework provides operational machinery for continental coordination across:

- **Financial Architecture**: Sovereign development finance, mineral funds, monetary integration
- **Security Integration**: United African Defence Force, cyber defence, space surveillance  
- **Resource Sovereignty**: Critical mineral governance, agricultural independence, energy transition
- **Digital Sovereignty**: Data localisation, African digital infrastructure, technology development
- **Trade Architecture**: Customs union, services integration, investment frameworks

This Framework addresses the €290 billion annual cost of fragmentation by providing operational machinery rather than aspirational rhetoric.
