## 📋 About

The African Federation Treaty Framework (AFTF) v3.1 delivers a rigorous, operational blueprint to resolve Africa's systemic fragmentation—estimated at over €290 billion in annual opportunity cost—through a self-executing Tripartite System anchored in absolute sovereignty, finance, defence, and algorithmic governance.

This version transitions the framework from conceptual design to a binding jurisprudential treatise, establishing the supremacy of Federation law and introducing critical new modules:
- Digital & Cognitive Sovereignty (Art. 8): Lattice-based cryptography and native synthetic intelligence to immunise African decision-making against external threats.
- Commercial & Logistical Anchors (Art. 9): Northlands (Nairobi) and Mai Mahiu (UADF HQ) as bonded trade facilitation hubs governed by OmniGaza® real-time settlement.
- Phased Governance Strata (Art. 10.6): Tiered onboarding (Silver, Gold, Platinum) via the Master Sovereign Investment Agreement (MSIA).
- Jurisdictional Finality (Art. 11–13): Federation Court with Supremacy Override, ensuring permanent constitutional federation.

Core Pillars:
- African Sovereign Development Finance Fund (ASDF) — generational infrastructure capital.
- OmniGaza® — sovereign-grade blockchain substrate for algorithmic fidelity, transparency, and settlement.
- United African Defence Force (UADF) — unified military and intelligence architecture.
- African Rare Earth Mineral Fund (AREMF) — sovereign control and value retention from critical minerals.

The AFTF is not aspirational rhetoric; it is executable machinery designed to eliminate fragmentation and secure Africa's €3.4 trillion+ economic future.
