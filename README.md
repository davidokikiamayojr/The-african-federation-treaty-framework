About the AFTF
The African Federation Treaty Framework (AFTF) v3.1 presents a rigorous, executable blueprint to eliminate Africa's systemic fragmentation — an estimated annual opportunity cost exceeding €290 billion — through a self-executing Tripartite System grounded in absolute sovereignty, sovereign finance, unified defence, and algorithmic governance.
This version formally establishes the supremacy of Federation law and introduces foundational new modules:
 * Digital & Cognitive Sovereignty (Art. 8) — Lattice-based cryptography and native synthetic intelligence to immunise African decision-making.
 * Commercial & Logistical Anchors (Art. 9) — Northlands (Nairobi) and Mai Mahiu (UADF HQ) trade facilitation hubs.
 * Phased Governance Strata (Art. 10.6) — Tiered onboarding (Silver, Gold, Platinum) governed by the Master Sovereign Investment Agreement (MSIA).
 * Jurisdictional Finality (Art. 11–13) — Federation Court with Supremacy Override.
Core Pillars
 * African Sovereign Development Finance Fund (ASDF) — Generational infrastructure capital engine.
 * OmniGaza® — Sovereign-grade blockchain substrate for algorithmic fidelity and instant settlement.
 * United African Defence Force (UADF) — Unified continental military and intelligence architecture.
 * African Rare Earth Mineral Fund (AREMF) — Sovereign control and value retention over critical minerals.
